"""Fail closed: if a Claude Code engine ever stops honoring "defer", the agent stops loudly.

Anthropic documents the "defer" decision in the Claude Code hooks docs, and the same
page says it is ignored in some cases. These tests simulate an engine that ignores
it, using the real engine and a local fake Messages API, and check that nothing runs
outside Temporal and that the step fails with a clear, non-retryable error instead of
finishing as if all were well.
